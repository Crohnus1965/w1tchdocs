Welcome to DIS2RBED's Lua Engine documentation!
===================================

**Lua Engine** (/lu'make/) is a DIS2RBED Menu feature for players who need more features 
than the built-in DIS2RBED Menu has.
It offers straightforward functions to interact with the game
and provides a lot of useful features for scripting.

Check out the :doc:`generalinfo` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`install` the project.
