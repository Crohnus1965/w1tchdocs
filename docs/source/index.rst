Welcome to DIS2RBED's Lua Engine documentation!
====================================================

**Lua Engine** is a DIS2RBED Menu feature for players who need more features 
than the built-in DIS2RBED Menu has.
It offers straightforward functions to interact with the game
and provides a lot of useful features for scripting.

Check out the :doc:`generalinfo` section for further information, as well as :doc:`gettingstarted`.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.


Special thanks to:

* Me (K1tty)
* MrDario
* Chiya
* Antrix
* DurtyFree for some useful parts of GTA V Dump data

This wouldn't have been possible without you!

Code snippets
---------------------------

Dear other mod menus,

If you plan on stealing this documentation for yourselves, please give us some credit! We've put efforts in this!
