Welcome to DIS2RBED's Lua Engine documentation!
===================================

**Lua Engine** is a DIS2RBED Menu feature for players who need more features 
than the built-in DIS2RBED Menu has.
It offers straightforward functions to interact with the game
and provides a lot of useful features for scripting.

Check out the :doc:`generalinfo` section for further information, as well as :doc:`gettingstarted`.
