so the headlines dont exist here
they're called 'sections'

quick cheat sheet:

First section
##############

Second section
=======================

it's important to note that that line should start from the newline right after the title, so this wouldn't work:

Third section (even smaller)
-------------------------------------

it is also important to note that the line should be equal or longer to the length of the section title, so this won't work:
